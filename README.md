# Project Intro
This project covers the week 11 Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)
  
The project briefing was as follows:  
  
*For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.
In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them..* 

The project includes the following elements:  
   - Landing page  
   - 8 Visualisations pages  
   - A 'Comparisons' page  
   - A Data page
